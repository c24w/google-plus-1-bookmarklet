Several variations available, as defined by the +1 button [http://code.google.com/apis/+1button/#button-sizes API].

_*Note*_: click bookmarklet once to show; click again to hide, or use the close button if you choose one of those variations.  Works best on your browser's bookmarks bar (if it has this feature).

====New/strange/irritating behaviours!====

(Noticed 08/08/11)

So, for whatever reason, in Chrome, the following is now happening for me:
  * dragging text prefixed with `javascript:` to the address bar removes the prefix, dumps the rest of the text in the address bar and doesn't execute the code!  Copying and pasting does the same.  You can just type `javascript:` in front after you drag/copy/paste, then hit enter and it should work as promised. Similar to Safari I remember, in my other whinging, below.  Dragging the '`javascript:`...' text to a bookmarks location still works a treat you'll be glad to hear!
  * this one seems to be working again (noticed 20/09/11)... ~~dragging a bookmarklet link, e.g. the +1 links generated by the [#New,_easier_method! new, easier method], no longer seems to name the bookmarklet using the text associated with the link, so you'll have to go and manually stick +1 back in its name property.~~

How annoying.

====An initial rant====

As you can see from the images, my experimentation is performed using Google Chrome.  My _methods_ may not work as described in all browsers, but the theory will probably be much the same.

In Internet Explorer (version 9.0.8), for example, it seems Microsoft enjoy dictating what you can and can't do, just to make it awkward:
  * you can't drag JavaScript to the bookmarks bar or address bar;
  * pasting JavaScript into the address bar removes the `javascript:` prefix, so you'll have to type it back in there;
  * you have to either
    * uncover the hidden favourites menu by pressing _Alt_, then click _Add to favourites bar_, or
    * press Ctrl+D
 then add a bookmark of the page you're on, then edit this bookmark by going to its properties...


Similarly, dragging JavaScript to Safari's address bar (version 5.0.5) anger<strike>s</strike>ed Steve Jobs (RIP):
  _Safari can’t use JavaScript for this action... Safari doesn’t allow JavaScript to be used in this way._
Although copying and pasting the same code, then pressing enter works a treat.  Thankfully, you can drag JavaScript to your bookmarks bar and type _+1_ when it asks for a name, or better still, use the [#New,_easier_method! new, easier method] and just drag one straight from there.

===Choosing the right one for you===
----

====New, easier method!====

See [http://goo.gl/sjVfa here].

====Old method====

  * [#Executing_code_in_your_address_bar execute] the following in your address bar (on this page); you will see +1 appear to the right of each [#Bookmarklets variation];
    ||`javascript:s=document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';document.body.appendChild(s);s.src='http://goo.gl/UUKfT';void(0);`||
    * to test, click on a +1;
    * to bookmark, drag a +1 to your bookmarks location.

====Oldest method====

  * choose which [#Bookmarklets variation] to test;
  * [#Executing_code_in_your_address_bar execute] the respective line of code for that variation (from the right hand column).
  _*Note*_: you'll have to either:
    * [#Executing_code_in_your_address_bar execute] the following between trying out different variations;
    ||`javascript:if(e=document.getElementById('myplusone'))e.parentNode.removeChild(e);`||
    * or refresh the page you are testing on.

 _Why?_  For efficiency, the +1 bookmarklet is only hidden from view when toggling the bookmarklet off.  Using a different variation causes the old variation to be made visible again, so this has to be removed first.

====Executing code in your address bar====

_*Note*_: you may like to read my [#Whinges whinges] if any of the following don't work for you.

  * either: highlight the line of code and drag it into your address bar

 http://google-plus-1-bookmarklet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/resources/try_it_drag.png

  * or: highlight the code, copy it, paste it into the address bar, press enter

===Creating a bookmarklet===
----

The easy way: see the [#New,_easier_method! new, easier method!] above.

The (old) easy way:
  * (might not be so easy afterall - [#An_initial_rant an initial rant]);
  * highlight the line of code in the right-hand column for the [#Bookmarklets variation] which you want; 
  * drag the highlighted text to your bookmarks bar (or other bookmarks location);
  * you'll probably then be able to name it _+1_, by editing it.

Alternatively:
  * create a new bookmark, according to your web-browser;
  * name it _+1_;
  * in the URL field, enter the line of code in the right-hand column for the [#Bookmarklets variation] which you want.

===Notes===
----

  * If I update the bookmarklet you are using, your version will update also, due to the way they have been created.
